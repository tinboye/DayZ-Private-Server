*****************************************************************************************************
Description:
*****************************************************************************************************


Schedules are created by adding a job with id.
The first schedule should always start with id="0"

<Scheduler>
	<job id="0">
		<day></day>
		<start></start>
		<runtime></runtime>
		<loop></loop>
		<cmd></cmd>
	</job>
	<job id="1">
		<day></day>
		<start></start>
		<runtime></runtime>
		<loop></loop>
		<cmd></cmd>
	</job>
</Scheduler>	

The job tag has 5 sub tags.

starting with:

<day>.../day>

The day of the week the schedule should run on.
Days are seperated by ',' 
<day>n</day> or <day>n,n+</day>

Monday starts with 1!

All days
<day>1,2,3,4,5,6,7</day>

Monday and Friday only.
<day>1,5</day>

Next:
<start>......</start> 
This tag may have one of two input format.

Format 1:
Contains 3 segments where each segment is a size of 2 in range of 00 - 99
Hour Min  Sec
[nn] [nn] [nn]
nnnnnn
Max value is 999999 and min value is 000000

<start>000090</start>
This will make the schedule execute 90 seconds after bec has started up and logged in.
Note that:

<start>000130</start>
Will also make the schedule execute 90 seconds after bec has started up.
as 90 sec is the same as 1 min and 30 sec

 
Format 2:
Contains 2 segments where each segment is a size of 2 in range of 00 - (23&59) and each segment is seperated by ':'

Hour   Min    Sec
[nn] : [nn] : [nn]

<start>23:05:30</start>
This will make the schedule execute precice at 23:05:30

To execute a schedule at midnight use:
<start>00:00:00</start>

To execute a schedule at noon use:
<start>12:00:00</start>


Next:
<runtime>....../runtime>
This tag uses the same format as the <start> tag format 1 (hhmmss), it also only work when the loop is set to -1 or higher than 0. ie 10
<runtime>hhmmss</runtime>


Next:
<loop>N</loop> 

If -1 is used it means it will loop forever.
If 0 is used the job will only be run once.
If a number higher than 0 is used it will loop the set numbers.
Each loop interval is set in the runtime tag. 

Example.
<runtime>001000</runtime>
<loop>5</loop>

this means that the job will loop 6 times with a 10 minute delay between each job after the jobstart
once "start" + number of loops

Next:
<cmd>Command</cmd>
Set the command that is to be executed.

you can use external commands. example 
<cmd>c:\path\myfile.bat</cmd>

or just use a internal command.
<cmd>uptime</cmd>
